**Live Demo:** [Click Here to Open the App](https://mobile-price-ai-d3esfeix83ut8skftgptar.streamlit.app/)

## 🌟 Project Overview
This project is an End-to-End Machine Learning application designed to estimate the market value of mobile phones based on their technical specifications. The system leverages a data-driven approach, having been trained on a cleaned dataset of **1,943 mobile devices** to provide accurate price forecasts.

## 🧠 The AI Model Concept
The core of this application is a **Random Forest Regressor** model that acts as a digital valuation expert. It analyzes the complex relationships between four key technical pillars to determine the price:
* **Performance (RAM):** Memory capacity in GB.
* **Power (Battery):** Battery capacity in mAh.
* **Optics (Camera):** Main camera resolution in Megapixels.
* **Design (Weight):** Physical device weight in grams.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
* **Language:** Python.
* **Libraries:** Pandas (Data Engineering), Scikit-Learn (Modeling), Joblib (Serialization).
* **Framework:** Streamlit (Web UI & Deployment).
* **Infrastructure:** GitHub & Streamlit Cloud.

## 📊 Data Engineering Excellence
A significant portion of this project involved extensive **Data Cleaning** and preprocessing:
* **Cleaning:** Resolved encoding issues and removed corrupted text/symbols from 1,943 records to ensure data integrity.
* **Transformation:** Categorical data was converted into numerical formats suitable for machine learning algorithms.
* **Visualization:** Integrated a market insights dashboard displaying brand distribution and tech trends.

## 🚀 How to Use
1. Navigate to the [Live App](https://mobile-price-ai-d3esfeix83ut8skftgptar.streamlit.app/).
2. Adjust the **Sliders** to set your desired mobile specifications.
3. Click **"Calculate Market Value"**.
4. The AI will instantly predict the fair market price in EUR (€).
